# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Web Developer Bootcamp. Videos 39 - 43 (CSS)

**Thoughts:** I want to make consistent progress on this course.

### Day 1: 16 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a few (super-easy) problems on UVa. Web Developer Bootcamp: Videos 44 - 45 (CSS selectors)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 2: 17 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Unit 5 (Intro to CSS) of [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content).

**Thoughts:** This is partly revision.

### Day 3: 18 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp 49-56 (started Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I didn't realise the significance of the colours in Chrome's inspector. 
* Content - blue
* Padding - green
*  Margin - orange

I like how this course makes note of things such as this.

I should try spending more time coding per day. I have more free time at the moment.

### Day 4: 19 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 6 (Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Making the image gallery and blog page was a nice exercise. Looking forward to making it more functional in the future when there's back end. (Same with the tic tac toe + JavaScript)
