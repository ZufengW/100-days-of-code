# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Web Developer Bootcamp. Videos 39 - 43 (CSS)

**Thoughts:** I want to make consistent progress on this course.

### Day 1: 16 June

**Today's Progress**: Did a few (super-easy) problems on UVa. Web Developer Bootcamp: Videos 44 - 45 (CSS selectors)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 2: 17 June

**Today's Progress**: Finished Unit 5 (Intro to CSS) of [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content).

**Thoughts:** This is partly revision.

### Day 3: 18 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp 49-56 (started Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I didn't realise the significance of the colours in Chrome's inspector. 
* Content - blue
* Padding - green
*  Margin - orange

I like how this course makes note of things such as this.

I should try spending more time coding per day. I have more free time at the moment.

### Day 4: 19 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 6 (Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Making the image gallery and blog page was a nice exercise. Looking forward to making it more functional in the future when there's back end. (Same with the tic tac toe + JavaScript)

### Day 5: 20 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Started section 7 (Bootstrap)

**Thoughts:** I actually did Free Code Camp a while back. Then I stopped (maybe around weather API), and I haven't returned yet. Right now I'm more interested in doing the (above mentioned) Web Developer Bootcamp. Either way, to complete an online course properly it is ideal to make consistent progress on a regular basis. This 100 days of code helps with that.

### Day 6: 21 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- nav bars, grid system)

**Thoughts:** Steady progress.

### Day 7: 22 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- Image gallery)

**Thoughts:** Eventually I should use this for projects not in the course.

### Day 8: 23 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Bootstrap -- Started Startup Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** Got home particularly late today. Started this at 11:40pm. I coded for less than an hour today, but I'm pretty sleepy. Edit: ended up doing a bit more after writing this.

### Day 9: 24 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 7 (Bootstrap). https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/RgZmQd/
Started section 8: Intro to JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to making more functional things.

### Day 10: 25 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 8 (Intro to JavaScript)

**Thoughts:** This section is easy.

### Day 11: 26 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 12: 27 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I did this earlier than usual -- finished at 10:30pm. It's better this way. Avoid studying after 11pm.

### Day 13: 28 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Did section 10 (JS basics: functions)

**Thoughts:** Partly revision, but also had some stuff that I wasn't fully aware of.

### Day 14: 29 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 11 (JS basics: arrays)

**Thoughts:** Not that hard. Partly revision since I've encountered arrays in many places, but there were new things.

### Day 15: 30 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 11. Started section 12 (JS basics: objects)

**Thoughts:** Less familiar than arrays and functions.

### Day 16: 01 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 12. Didn't do as much today due to tiredness (due to staying up til 12:20 am)

**Thoughts:** It would be better if I planned ahead and did the coding earlier on days such as this to avoid staying up too late.

### Day 17: 02 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 12. Doing section 13 (DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** It's nice that this topic builds upon the objects topic.

### Day 18: 03 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 13 (DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend as much today due to some other things that I had to do this evening. But since I've done this ~19 days in a row, it's more like a habit now. It would feel strange not to do it.

### Day 19: 04 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 13 (DOM manipulation). Started section 14 (advanced DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I was vaguely aware of little bits here and there, but following this course makes it more cohesive.
