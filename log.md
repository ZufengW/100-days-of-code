# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Web Developer Bootcamp. Videos 39 - 43 (CSS)

**Thoughts:** I want to make consistent progress on this course.

### Day 1: 16 June

**Today's Progress**: Did a few (super-easy) problems on UVa. Web Developer Bootcamp: Videos 44 - 45 (CSS selectors)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 2: 17 June

**Today's Progress**: Finished Unit 5 (Intro to CSS) of [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content).

**Thoughts:** This is partly revision.

### Day 3: 18 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp 49-56 (started Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I didn't realise the significance of the colours in Chrome's inspector. 
* Content - blue
* Padding - green
*  Margin - orange

I like how this course makes note of things such as this.

I should try spending more time coding per day. I have more free time at the moment.

### Day 4: 19 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 6 (Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Making the image gallery and blog page was a nice exercise. Looking forward to making it more functional in the future when there's back end. (Same with the tic tac toe + JavaScript)

### Day 5: 20 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Started section 7 (Bootstrap)

**Thoughts:** I actually did Free Code Camp a while back. Then I stopped (maybe around weather API), and I haven't returned yet. Right now I'm more interested in doing the (above mentioned) Web Developer Bootcamp. Either way, to complete an online course properly it is ideal to make consistent progress on a regular basis. This 100 days of code helps with that.

### Day 6: 21 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- nav bars, grid system)

**Thoughts:** Steady progress.

### Day 7: 22 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- Image gallery)

**Thoughts:** Eventually I should use this for projects not in the course.

### Day 8: 23 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Bootstrap -- Started Startup Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** Got home particularly late today. Started this at 11:40pm. I coded for less than an hour today, but I'm pretty sleepy. Edit: ended up doing a bit more after writing this.

### Day 9: 24 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 7 (Bootstrap). https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/RgZmQd/
Started section 8: Intro to JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to making more functional things.

### Day 10: 25 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 8 (Intro to JavaScript)

**Thoughts:** This section is easy.

### Day 11: 26 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 12: 27 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I did this earlier than usual -- finished at 10:30pm. It's better this way. Avoid studying after 11pm.

### Day 13: 28 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Did section 10 (JS basics: functions)

**Thoughts:** Partly revision, but also had some stuff that I wasn't fully aware of.

### Day 14: 29 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 11 (JS basics: arrays)

**Thoughts:** Not that hard. Partly revision since I've encountered arrays in many places, but there were new things.

### Day 15: 30 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 11. Started section 12 (JS basics: objects)

**Thoughts:** Less familiar than arrays and functions.

### Day 16: 01 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 12. Didn't do as much today due to tiredness (due to staying up til 12:20 am)

**Thoughts:** It would be better if I planned ahead and did the coding earlier on days such as this to avoid staying up too late.

### Day 17: 02 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 12. Doing section 13 (DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** It's nice that this topic builds upon the objects topic.

### Day 18: 03 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 13 (DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend as much today due to some other things that I had to do this evening. But since I've done this ~19 days in a row, it's more like a habit now. It would feel strange not to do it.

### Day 19: 04 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 13 (DOM manipulation). Started section 14 (advanced DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I was vaguely aware of little bits here and there, but following this course makes it more cohesive.

### Day 20: 05 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 14 (advanced DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** Each unit adds more complexity. The next section (colour game project) looks interesting. It's functional and looks much more polished than the usual examples and coding tasks. I'm also looking forward to doing backend eventually.

### Day 21: 06 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Working on section 15 (Colour Game Project)

**Thoughts:** This project is longer than all the previous ones in the course. This makes it more difficult to structure the building process, but Colt explained it well.

### Day 22: 07 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 15 (Colour Game Project) https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/gRdMzR

**Thoughts:** A project like this is good for tying together different ideas from earlier in the course. It doesn't look too good on phone though -- the button row doesn't fit on narrow screens. I also add an extra feature: streak counter. 

### Day 23: 08 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing unit 16 (Intro to jQuery) 

**Thoughts:** I think it's good that this topic is after all the DOM manipulation because it makes us less dependent on jQuery. I also like how Colt talked about both reasons for using jQuery and [reasons for not using jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/). 

### Day 24: 09 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 16 (Intro to jQuery). Doing unit 17 (Advanced jQuery)

**Thoughts:** These methods are similar to the plain JS methods.

### Day 25: 10 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 17 (Advanced jQuery). Doing unit 18 (jQuery Todo app). Also made a [placeholder text generator](https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/ZymLbJ/) for the heck of it.

**Thoughts:** The functionality in this second project looks interesting. Users can create and delete Todos, and they can toggle between complete and incomplete.
Next steps for a Todo app could include adding tags and descriptions to todos. Maybe sorting and reordering them. Coding that would be difficult though.

The Menu Ipsum thing I made has a lot of adjectives and modifiers relating to food, but not many nouns. That's the point.

### Day 26: 11 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Continued unit 18 (jQuery Todo app).

**Thoughts:** I'll finish this tomorrow.

### Day 27: 12 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 18 (jQuery Todo project) and finished unit 20 (Backend Basics). 
https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/qjLRyQ
Skipped 19 (Patatap Clone) since it is optional, but I might do it later.

**Thoughts:** Backend is new territory. Looking forward to see where this goes. [c9](https://c9.io/zufeng) looks great. Easy to get started and generous free plan.

### Day 28: 13 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 21 (Command Line). 

**Thoughts:** It would have been nice if I had known this stuff earlier. The [link(s)](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) that Colt provided was useful.

### Day 29: 14 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 22 (Node JS). 

**Thoughts:** A new topic covered in this section is [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com). It certainly made it easier to use packages.

### Day 30: 15 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Started unit 23 (Server side frameworks). 
Started using express framework.

**Thoughts:** Bit tired -- doing this late in the day. Will resume tomorrow.

### Day 31: 16 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Continued unit 23 (Server side frameworks). 
Things about package.json

**Thoughts:** Again, doing this quite late after busy day. Will resume tomorrow.

I also participated the [weekly contest on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/contest/leetcode-weekly-contest-41/) this morning, during which I answered the first two questions. Apart from this paragraph, I haven't been writing about this sort of (competitive programming) stuff in the log because I'm not sure if it should count for 100DaysOfCode, but it's still coding.

### Day 32: 17 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 23. Doing unit 24 (Intermediate express)

**Thoughts:** I probably spent more time on the course today than the past two days since I had less other stuff scheduled today.
