# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Web Developer Bootcamp. Videos 39 - 43 (CSS)

**Thoughts:** I want to make consistent progress on this course.

### Day 1: 16 June

**Today's Progress**: Did a few (super-easy) problems on UVa. Web Developer Bootcamp: Videos 44 - 45 (CSS selectors)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 2: 17 June

**Today's Progress**: Finished Unit 5 (Intro to CSS) of [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content).

**Thoughts:** This is partly revision.

### Day 3: 18 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp 49-56 (started Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I didn't realise the significance of the colours in Chrome's inspector. 
* Content - blue
* Padding - green
*  Margin - orange

I like how this course makes note of things such as this.

I should try spending more time coding per day. I have more free time at the moment.

### Day 4: 19 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 6 (Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Making the image gallery and blog page was a nice exercise. Looking forward to making it more functional in the future when there's back end. (Same with the tic tac toe + JavaScript)

### Day 5: 20 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Started section 7 (Bootstrap)

**Thoughts:** I actually did Free Code Camp a while back. Then I stopped (maybe around weather API), and I haven't returned yet. Right now I'm more interested in doing the (above mentioned) Web Developer Bootcamp. Either way, to complete an online course properly it is ideal to make consistent progress on a regular basis. This 100 days of code helps with that.

### Day 6: 21 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- nav bars, grid system)

**Thoughts:** Steady progress.

### Day 7: 22 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- Image gallery)

**Thoughts:** Eventually I should use this for projects not in the course.

### Day 8: 23 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Bootstrap -- Started Startup Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** Got home particularly late today. Started this at 11:40pm. I coded for less than an hour today, but I'm pretty sleepy. Edit: ended up doing a bit more after writing this.

### Day 9: 24 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 7 (Bootstrap). https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/RgZmQd/
Started section 8: Intro to JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to making more functional things.

### Day 10: 25 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 8 (Intro to JavaScript)

**Thoughts:** This section is easy.

### Day 11: 26 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 12: 27 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I did this earlier than usual -- finished at 10:30pm. It's better this way. Avoid studying after 11pm.
