# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 15 June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Web Developer Bootcamp. Videos 39 - 43 (CSS)

**Thoughts:** I want to make consistent progress on this course.

### Day 1: 16 June

**Today's Progress**: Did a few (super-easy) problems on UVa. Web Developer Bootcamp: Videos 44 - 45 (CSS selectors)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 2: 17 June

**Today's Progress**: Finished Unit 5 (Intro to CSS) of [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content).

**Thoughts:** This is partly revision.

### Day 3: 18 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp 49-56 (started Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I didn't realise the significance of the colours in Chrome's inspector. 
* Content - blue
* Padding - green
*  Margin - orange

I like how this course makes note of things such as this.

I should try spending more time coding per day. I have more free time at the moment.

### Day 4: 19 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 6 (Intermediate CSS)

**Thoughts:** Making the image gallery and blog page was a nice exercise. Looking forward to making it more functional in the future when there's back end. (Same with the tic tac toe + JavaScript)

### Day 5: 20 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Started section 7 (Bootstrap)

**Thoughts:** I actually did Free Code Camp a while back. Then I stopped (maybe around weather API), and I haven't returned yet. Right now I'm more interested in doing the (above mentioned) Web Developer Bootcamp. Either way, to complete an online course properly it is ideal to make consistent progress on a regular basis. This 100 days of code helps with that.

### Day 6: 21 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- nav bars, grid system)

**Thoughts:** Steady progress.

### Day 7: 22 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 7 (Bootstrap -- Image gallery)

**Thoughts:** Eventually I should use this for projects not in the course.

### Day 8: 23 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Bootstrap -- Started Startup Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** Got home particularly late today. Started this at 11:40pm. I coded for less than an hour today, but I'm pretty sleepy. Edit: ended up doing a bit more after writing this.

### Day 9: 24 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 7 (Bootstrap). https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/RgZmQd/
Started section 8: Intro to JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to making more functional things.

### Day 10: 25 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 8 (Intro to JavaScript)

**Thoughts:** This section is easy.

### Day 11: 26 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I should do this earlier in the day.

### Day 12: 27 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 9 (JS basics: control flow)

**Thoughts:** I did this earlier than usual -- finished at 10:30pm. It's better this way. Avoid studying after 11pm.

### Day 13: 28 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Did section 10 (JS basics: functions)

**Thoughts:** Partly revision, but also had some stuff that I wasn't fully aware of.

### Day 14: 29 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 11 (JS basics: arrays)

**Thoughts:** Not that hard. Partly revision since I've encountered arrays in many places, but there were new things.

### Day 15: 30 June

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 11. Started section 12 (JS basics: objects)

**Thoughts:** Less familiar than arrays and functions.

### Day 16: 01 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 12. Didn't do as much today due to tiredness (due to staying up til 12:20 am)

**Thoughts:** It would be better if I planned ahead and did the coding earlier on days such as this to avoid staying up too late.

### Day 17: 02 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 12. Doing section 13 (DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** It's nice that this topic builds upon the objects topic.

### Day 18: 03 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing section 13 (DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend as much today due to some other things that I had to do this evening. But since I've done this ~19 days in a row, it's more like a habit now. It would feel strange not to do it.

### Day 19: 04 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 13 (DOM manipulation). Started section 14 (advanced DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** Previously, I was vaguely aware of little bits here and there, but following this course makes it more cohesive.

### Day 20: 05 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished section 14 (advanced DOM manipulation)

**Thoughts:** Each unit adds more complexity. The next section (colour game project) looks interesting. It's functional and looks much more polished than the usual examples and coding tasks. I'm also looking forward to doing backend eventually.

### Day 21: 06 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Working on section 15 (Colour Game Project)

**Thoughts:** This project is longer than all the previous ones in the course. This makes it more difficult to structure the building process, but Colt explained it well.

### Day 22: 07 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 15 (Colour Game Project) https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/gRdMzR

**Thoughts:** A project like this is good for tying together different ideas from earlier in the course. It doesn't look too good on phone though -- the button row doesn't fit on narrow screens. I also add an extra feature: streak counter. 

### Day 23: 08 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Doing unit 16 (Intro to jQuery) 

**Thoughts:** I think it's good that this topic is after all the DOM manipulation because it makes us less dependent on jQuery. I also like how Colt talked about both reasons for using jQuery and [reasons for not using jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/). 

### Day 24: 09 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 16 (Intro to jQuery). Doing unit 17 (Advanced jQuery)

**Thoughts:** These methods are similar to the plain JS methods.

### Day 25: 10 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 17 (Advanced jQuery). Doing unit 18 (jQuery Todo app). Also made a [placeholder text generator](https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/ZymLbJ/) for the heck of it.

**Thoughts:** The functionality in this second project looks interesting. Users can create and delete Todos, and they can toggle between complete and incomplete.
Next steps for a Todo app could include adding tags and descriptions to todos. Maybe sorting and reordering them. Coding that would be difficult though.

The Menu Ipsum thing I made has a lot of adjectives and modifiers relating to food, but not many nouns. That's the point.

### Day 26: 11 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Continued unit 18 (jQuery Todo app).

**Thoughts:** I'll finish this tomorrow.

### Day 27: 12 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 18 (jQuery Todo project) and finished unit 20 (Backend Basics). 
https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/qjLRyQ
Skipped 19 (Patatap Clone) since it is optional, but I might do it later.

**Thoughts:** Backend is new territory. Looking forward to see where this goes. [c9](https://c9.io/zufeng) looks great. Easy to get started and generous free plan.

### Day 28: 13 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 21 (Command Line). 

**Thoughts:** It would have been nice if I had known this stuff earlier. The [link(s)](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) that Colt provided was useful.

### Day 29: 14 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 22 (Node JS). 

**Thoughts:** A new topic covered in this section is [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com). It certainly made it easier to use packages.

### Day 30: 15 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Started unit 23 (Server side frameworks). 
Started using express framework.

**Thoughts:** Bit tired -- doing this late in the day. Will resume tomorrow.

### Day 31: 16 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Continued unit 23 (Server side frameworks). 
Things about package.json

**Thoughts:** Again, doing this quite late after busy day. Will resume tomorrow.

I also participated the [weekly contest on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/contest/leetcode-weekly-contest-41/) this morning, during which I answered the first two questions. Apart from this paragraph, I haven't been writing about this sort of (competitive programming) stuff in the log because I'm not sure if it should count for 100DaysOfCode, but it's still coding.

### Day 32: 17 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 23. Doing unit 24 (Intermediate express)

**Thoughts:** I probably spent more time on the course today than the past two days since I had less other stuff scheduled today. 

### Day 33: 18 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Developer Bootcamp: Finished unit 24 (Intermediate express). EJS and post requests.

I also experimented with a JS library called [vis](http://visjs.org) to visualise a graph of university subject prerequisites. It would be nice if I could make something that fetches data and generates those graphs automatically, but that would be tricky. This idea is something to keep in mind.

**Thoughts:** There's still a long way to go to finish this course. But the consistency of doing a bit each day will get me there eventually.

### Day 34: 19 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Started unit 25 (working with APIs).

I continued experimenting with the graph viewer. I also wrote some Python to scrape data from the [website](http://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/). Given a subject code or list of subject codes, it returns a list of nodes and a list of edges in the format suitable for the JS file.
Parsing the text correctly is tricky due to the inconsistencies in text structure. 
See https://codepen.io/ZufengW/full/QgXbag/ for graph of an output.

**Thoughts:** Things will get more busy starting next week.

What if that handbook had an API? That could make things easier.

### Day 35: 20 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Finished unit 25 (working with APIs).

**Thoughts:** I stayed up a little later to finish it.

### Day 36: 21 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Started unit 26 (YelpCamp: Basics)

**Thoughts:** It'll be a substantial app with front end and back end. Also, it uses Bootstrap, which I haven't touched for a while. This retrieval will help me to remember it.

### Day 37: 22 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Finished unit 26 (YelpCamp: Basics)

**Thoughts:** I stayed up fairly late to finish this.
Notably, some of the Bootstrap-related problems that Colt mentioned did not happen to me. Maybe the newer versions of Bootstrap changed things.

### Day 38: 23 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Started unit 27 (Databases)

Also did Leetcode comp again.

**Thoughts:** Now using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com). I wonder if it's still as popular as Colt said it was.


### Day 39: 24 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Continued unit 27 (Databases)

**Thoughts:** I'll finish this tomorrow.

### Day 40: 25 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Finished unit 27 (Databases). Started unit 28 (adding Mongoose to YelpCamp)

**Thoughts:** I'll finish this tomorrow.

### Day 41: 26 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Finished unit 28 (adding Mongoose to YelpCamp)

**Thoughts:** Finally, an app with data persistence. It retains the campgrounds from previous sessions.
I stayed up pretty late finishing this.

### Day 42: 27 July

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp: Started unit 29 (RESTful routing)

**Thoughts:** This is a project that features all seven RESTful routes. 

Now that University has started again, things are more busy. I'm also doing three computing subjects at the moment.

### Day 43: 28 July

**Today's Progress**: Made a [Hackerrank account](https://www.hackerrank.com/zufengw) and did some Python practice. Did a small amount of web dev bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I'll do more tomorrow.

### Day 44: 29 July

**Today's Progress**: Did more Python practice. Continued Web dev bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) looks interesting. It's good to have some variety instead of just Bootstrap.

### Day 45: 30 July

**Today's Progress**: More Python problems. Continued Web dev bootcamp (unit 29: RESTful routing).

**Thoughts:** Slow progress on web dev bootcamp. But doing a little bit each day is definitely better than not doing it at all.

### Day 46: 31 July

**Today's Progress**: Continued Web dev bootcamp (unit 29: RESTful routing).

**Thoughts:** Now there's more code from my university subjects, but I won't count those for 100 Days of Code.

Prelim

### Day 47: 1 August (Tue)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp (finished unit 29: RESTful routing).

**Thoughts:**   There's another interesting looking course: fast.ai

### Day 48: 2 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp (started unit 30: Data associations).

**Thoughts:** I didn't do as much today because I was doing something else that went over time. I need to be more organised.

### Day 49: 3 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 30: Data associations. (Followed one video)

**Thoughts:** Another busy day.

### Day 50: 6 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 30: Data associations.
Also redid my home page that I use for my Safari browser.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do this for the past few days because I went on a camp. But now I'm home. Resuming the count today.

### Day 51: 7 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- finished unit 30: Data associations. Started unit 31: YelpCamp comments
(Object references and moving models to separate files)

**Thoughts:** It was fine. Looking forward to adding comments.

### Day 52: 8 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 31: YelpCamp comments. 
Also made: http://codepen.io/ZufengW/pen/MvpbLe

**Thoughts:** After hearing about the diamond-square algorithm, I thought it was interesting. So I made this visualisation in JS.

### Day 53: 10 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 31: YelpCamp comments.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do this yesterday. It was 1am and decided to go to sleep instead.
When the assignments start rolling in, there'll be even less time.

### Day 54: 11 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 31: YelpCamp comments. (Creating comments)

**Thoughts:** Doing this late again, but I should have time tomorrow.

### Day 55: 12 August (Sat)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 31: YelpCamp comments.

**Thoughts:** I'm certainly spending more days on each unit now. I'll try to finish this one tomorrow.

### Day 56: 13 August (Sun)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- finished unit 31: YelpCamp comments

**Thoughts:** Now each campground show page has a styled comments section.

### Day 57: 14 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- started unit 32: Authentication

**Thoughts:** It is interesting to hear Colt's considerations on how to teach this topic. He chose to make this session quicker with the assistance of packages. The theory is lighter, but the working prototype gets built in less time. Then there's an optional unit near the end that does authentication in more depth from scratch. How would this structure of learning apply to different areas?

### Day 58: 15 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 32: Authentication

**Thoughts:** Another late-ish night.

### Day 59: 16 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 32: Authentication
Now users can register.

**Thoughts:** I considered skipping today because it was so late again (like last week), but I continued anyway. 

### Day 60: 17 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- finished unit 32: Authentication
Now users can log out.

**Thoughts:** All this will be used in YelpCamp.

### Day 61: 18 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- started unit 33: Adding authentication to YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:** So many packages and strange methods. Maybe I should read the docs for each module.

### Day 62: 19 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 33: 

**Thoughts:** Lots of logs scene

### Day 63: 20 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- finished unit 33: Adding authentication to YelpCamp.
Now only logged-in users can post comments.

**Thoughts:** (I'm not even sure what the thing I wrote yesterday for "Thoughts" is supposed to mean.)
Recently I started keeping a list of features that could be added to the bootcamp projects. They might not get covered in the course but adding them would be good practice. E.g. show messages such as "username already exists" to the user and disallow usernames containing non alphanumeric characters.

### Day 64: 21 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- started unit 34: Cleaning up YelpCamp.
Refactoring the code in app.js

**Thoughts:** Practical stuff. 

### Day 65: 22 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 34: Cleaning up YelpCamp.
Now comments just show the user's username as the author.

**Thoughts:** So much stuff. So little time.

### Day 66: 23 August (Wed)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- continued unit 34: Cleaning up YelpCamp. I'll finish this unit tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need to change when I do this. On days such as today (Wed) and Monday, I should do this at the start of the day (instead of at the end). When leaving it til the end, I always end up losing sleep


### Day 67: 24 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- finished unit 34: Cleaning up YelpCamp. Started unit 35: update and destroy

**Thoughts:** Soon there'll be edit and update routes for the campgrounds.

### Day 68: 25 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 35: update and destroy. Adding the edit and update routes.

**Thoughts:** I think at some point I introduced a mistake that's causing a "CastError". I'll need to figure out where it is.

### Day 69: 26 August

**Today's Progress**: Tried fixing some issues encountered yesterday.

**Thoughts:** It might be better now. Maybe.

### Day 70: 27 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 35: Update and destroy. Now there are buttons to do both, but anyone can edit and delete at the moment.

**Thoughts:** I didn't encounter the issue from yesterday anymore.

### Day 71: 28 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 35: Update and destroy. Authorisation. Now only the owner of a campground can edit and delete it.

**Thoughts:** Things are getting busy.

### Day 72: 29 August

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 35: Update and destroy. Now we're adding the same routes, but to comments.

**Thoughts:** I will finish this tomorrow morning.

### Day 73: 31 August (Thur)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 35: Update and destroy. 

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty busy at the moment (and I skipped a day yesterday).

### Day 74: 1 September (Fri)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 35: Update and destroy. Can delete comments now.
Also spent some time fixing stuff from yesterday. I definitely make more weird mistakes while drowsy. Working like that is inefficient.

**Thoughts:** This time for sure. I'll finish this unit tomorrow.

### Day 75: 2 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Finished unit 35: Update and destroy. Now have to be logged in to update/delete comments. Started unit 36.

**Thoughts:** There aren't many units left.

### Day 76: 3 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 36: UI improvements. Flash messages show up on some pages now.

**Thoughts:** Looks like [connect-flash](https://github.com/jaredhanson/connect-flash) hasn't been updated in a while.
And I got a new laptop today!


### Day 77: 4 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 36: UI improvements. (worked through Flash messages: helpful errors)

**Thoughts:** I would like to finish the course by the end of these 100 days. It's been slow progress over the past few weeks, but I'll make it if I spend my time well.

### Day 78: 5 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Continued unit 36. Started refactor of landing page.

**Thoughts:** Doing it now (after 11pm) doesn't feel very efficient today. I'll aim to finish this unit first thing tomorrow morning.

### Day 79: 6 September (Wed)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Finished unit 36. Price is now another campground attribute.

**Thoughts:** I did end up doing this in the morning. It was good. I should aim to do this kind of stuff on more Wednesday mornings. 

### Day 80: 7 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Started unit 37: Git

**Thoughts:** I had never really gotten around to learning Git until now. 

### Day 81: 8 September (Fri)

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Finished unit 37: Git

**Thoughts:** This unit has yet to be completed. They didn't talk about GitHub or branching, etc. There are plenty of other resources online though.

### Day 82: 9 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Started unit 38: Deploying

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to deploying YelpCamp

### Day 83: 10 September

**Today's Progress**: Web dev bootcamp -- Finished unit 38: Deploying
YelpCamp is deployed to [https://powerful-journey-99097.herokuapp.com](https://powerful-journey-99097.herokuapp.com)

I also added an additional feature restricting the types of characters that can be used in a username. Previously, it was possible to have usernames containing only spaces.

**Thoughts:** Now the app should be available 24/7. Both the app and the database are hosted using free plans, but it's a big leap forward compared to running on C9.
